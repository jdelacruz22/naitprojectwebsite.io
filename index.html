                        <p>Game programming refers to the use of computer programming languages, such as C programming language, C++, java, to write games on computers, mobile phones or game consoles. The popular game programing language is C++ language, and the game programming interface is DirectX (Direct eXtension) 9.0, OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). The games now paly on mobile phones are divided into Android and IOS platforms, using java and project-c (or swift). Nowadays, some cross-platform programming engines are also popular, such as cocos2d-x, unity 3D.</p>
                        <p>The Digital Media and IT (DMIT) program is multi-disciplinary in its approach. Spanning a range of career opportunities from business analyst to visual designer, this innovative program allows you the ability to meet industry demand while developing skills aligned with your individual talents and inclinations.</p>
                        <p>In the Game Programming area of emphasis, you will learn how to give life to video games. You will create and implement game code and scripts that support environments, characters, vehicles, cameras and special effects and allow them to interact with each other.</p>

                    <p>The courses in this area of emphasis offer a multi-language approach to object-oriented programming (OOP), which is an approach to designing modular, reusable software systems. You'll also learn how multi-language programming functions on various game engines and platforms.</p>
                    <p>You will become familiar with programming languages such as C++, C# and JavaScript, languages that are at the core of game programming. You will then learn how to plan and create small games – on your own as well as with your classmates.</p>

This programmer writes the code specifying how input devices such as a keyboard, mouse or joystick affect the game. These routines are typically developed early in production and are continually tweaked during development. Normally, one programmer does not need to dedicate his entire time to developing these systems. A real-time motion-controlled game utilizing devices such as the Wii Remote or Kinect may need a very complex and low latency input system, while the HID requirements of a mouse-driven turn-based strategy game such as Heroes of Might and Magic are significantly simpler to implement.</p>

Programmers implementing these game features can spend all their time in this one role, which is often considered one of the most technically challenging. Network latency, packet compression, and dropped or interrupted connections are just a few of the concerns one must consider. Although multi-player features can consume the entire production timeline and require the other engine systems to be designed with networking in mind, network systems are often put off until the last few months of development, adding additional difficulties to this role. Some titles have had their online features (often considered lower priority than the core gameplay) cut months away from release due to concerns such as lack of management, design forethought, or scalability. Virtua Fighter 5 for the PS3 is a notable example of this trend.</p>

Tasks cover a broad range of subjects including the practical implementation of algorithms described in research papers, very low-level assembly optimization and the ability to solve challenging issues pertaining to memory requirements and caching issues during the latter stages of a project.

                                    <p>The lead programmer is ultimately in charge of all programming for the game. It is their job to make sure the various submodules of the game are being implemented properly and to keep track of development from a programming standpoint. A person in this role usually transitions from other aspects of game programming to this role after several years of experience. Despite the title, this person usually has less time for writing code than other programmers on the project as they are required to attend meetings and interface with the client or other leads on the game. However, the lead programmer is still expected to program at least some of the time and is also expected to be knowledgeable in most technical areas of the game. There is often considerable common ground in the role of technical director and lead programmer, such that the jobs are often covered by one person.</p>
